[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javaTheHutts/Java-the-Hutts.svg?branch=Develop)](https://travis-ci.org/javaTheHutts/Java-the-Hutts)

Repository for the Java the Hutts team for COS301.

## Setup of development environment
You will need to install the following pacakges:

- `virtualenv`
- `pip3.5`
- `python3.5`

To set up the development environment and be able to use `pybuilder`, execute the following commands:

1. `cd` into this repository.
2. `virtualenv -p python3.5 venv` (this creates a virtual environment to work in)
3. `source venv/bin/activate` (this activates the virtual environment in order to use the commands available to it, specifically **PyBuilder**)
4. `pip3.5 install pybuilder` (installs `pybuilder`).
5. `pyb install_dependencies` (installs the necessary dependencies for pybuilder)
6. `pyb` (builds the python project)

When you are finished developing in this environment, simply call `deactivate` in order to exit the virtual environment.

## Building and installing the project
1. Execute `source venv/bin/activate` (you need only do this once in order to enter your virtual environment).
2. Execute `make` in the root folder (the folder where `build.py` and `makefile` is located). This builds the project, runs the unit tests, runs the integration tests, lints the files and creates a portable distribution of the project ready for installation, and installs it in the Python environment.

### Extra tasks
- If you only want to lint the project, run `make lint`.
- If you only want to run the unit tests, run `make utest`.
- For only integration testing, run `make itest`.
- To run both sets of tests only, run `make test`.
- To skip the linting, run `make build`. This will build and run the tests without linting the files.

Once you are finished, execute the command `deactivate` in order to exit your virtual environment.

## Starting the server
1. After building and installing the project, run the script `run.py` in the scripts directory to start the server hosting the API.
2. Requests can then be sent to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the API.
3. Refer to the User Manual under `documentation/user-manual` for detailed instructions regarding requests, parameters and return types.

## Directory structure
```
.
├── documentation
├── src
│   ├── integrationtest
│   │   └── python
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── python
│   │   └── scripts
│   └── unittest
│       └── python
├── target
│   ├── dist
│   └── reports
└── venv
```

- All the Python packages and commands necessary for the system can be found in `venv`. This directory and its contents is generated when you create your virtual environment. It should not be necessary for you to edit anything within this directory.
- `documentation` contains the documentation of the system. This includes all the LateX and PDF files.
- `target` is generated each time the `pyb` command executed. This directory contains all the generated source code in a structure that is generally used to distribute and install Python applications. Any changes you make here will not be saved when you rebuild the project.
    - `dist` contains the portable distribution and generated source code of the application.
    - `reports` contains all the different reports generated by the unit testing, integration testing and code coverage modules.
- `src` is where all the source code and resources for the application is stored. This includes runnable scripts, classes, unit tests, integration tests, images, etc.
    - `integrationtest/python` is where all the integration tests can be found. Each file should start with the prefix `itest_` followed by the rest of the filename.
    - `unittest/python` is where all the unit tests can be found. Each file should start with the prefix `test_` followed by the rest of the filename.
    - `main/python` is where all the main source code for the application can be found, such as class and function definitions.
    - `main/scripts` contains all the runnable scripts for the application. This is where you will typically find the entry-point into the application.

## Important files
- `build.py` contains the configuration used by PyBuilder to build the project. Any plugins and customized build settings are contained in this file.
- `README.md`. This file explains how the entire system should be built and used. Refer to it before asking any questions about the build process.
