\section{Execution}
    \subsection{Administrative Tasks}
        \subsubsection{Meetings}
            We firmly believe that active user involvement is imperative and will have frequent meetings with the client during development as well. We would like to work closely with the client to ensure that requirements misconceptions are corrected early on and that the client's feedback can be addressed properly and timely. The exact details and times of these meetings will be negotiated with the client. We do, however, think that it is imperative for at least the following meetings to happen:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item As soon as the project is allocated and before the first demo (between 18 May 2017 and 25 May 2017)
                \item After the first demo (week of 29 May 2017 to 2 June 2017)
                \item In the week before or after the second demo (from 24 July 2017 to 4 August 2017)
                \item In the week before or after the third demo (from 28 August 2017 to 8 September 2017)
                \item In the week before the final evaluation phase starts (from 9 October 2017 to 13 October 2017)
            \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Development}
        \subsubsection{Methodology}
        We plan on following the Agile Unified Methodology to implement this product. We will develop this product in iterations and strive to have a working prototype at all times. We feel that it is beneficial to adopt an iterative approach to our development rather than a sequential process like Waterfall. This will ensure that design issues and changes in requirements are identified early on, and will allow us to deliver a working system within our time constraints. We will have a brief planning phase in which we identify requirements, derive use cases and assign those use cases to iterations. Changes in requirements will be addressed during the requirements phase of each of the following iterations. We will have weekly team meetings and will have set meetings with the client after each iteration.
